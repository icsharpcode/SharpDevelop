written by Jon Rista,
I wanted to show you how to write that AddIn for SharpDevelop.<br>
In this article I will show you how to create an AddIn, but I will not discuss
the concepts of the SharpDevelop's AddIn architecture here - you can read more
about that in my article
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/ICSharpCodeCore.asp" title="Building Applications with the SharpDevelop Core">Building
Applications with the SharpDevelop Core</a>
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/ICSharpCodeCore.asp" target="_blank" title="Building Applications with the SharpDevelop Core">[^]</a>.
The line counter code is taken from the VS 2005 AddIn written by Jon Rista; the
counting algorithm itself is from Oz Solomon.<br> I will discuss every of my changes to the code in this article - after all, there aren't so many changes required.
<br>
<h2>
  Creating a new AddIn
</h2>
Our AddIn will be a menu entry in the "Tools" menu that opens a document window
displaying the line counter UI. While it is possible to develop SharpDevelop AddIns in Visual Studio, you can get
started a lot faster if you use SharpDevelop because it already comes with a project
template for an AddIn extending the "Tools" menu: "Tools menu entry".<br>
<img src="LineCounterSDAddIn/templatetype.png"><br>
<br>
We create a SharpDevelop AddIn with the name "LineCounter". The "SharpDevelop
AddIn" template could also be used, but it starts with an AddIn defining a pad
(a docked tool window like "Projects", "Properties"); the "Tool menu entry"
AddIn starts with a menu command.<br>
Now let's look at what SharpDevelop has generated for us:<br>
We have a project with a few files:<br>
<img src="LineCounterSDAddIn/projectbrowser.png"><br>
First look at the .addin file:<br>
The template already defines a menu item in the tools menu, we'll just modify
the label. And we'll add a new section to the .addin file: the &lt;Manifest&gt;
section. Our AddIn needs a unique identity - use something like a namespace
name. Because we don't want lots of AddIns with the identity "AddIn1" around,
the template does not contain the manifest section by default. The identity is
not strictly required, but it allows us to use SharpDevelop's AddIn manager for
our AddIn - and it is also required when other AddIns want to reference your
AddIn. Because the API between SharpDevelop 2.0.x.y and SharpDevelop 2.1.a.b
will change a bit, we use the dependency to ensure that our AddIn can only be
installed into SharpDevelop 2.0.*.*.<br>
Since our LineCounter will only work when a solution is opened, we put the menu
item inside a &lt;Condition name="SolutionOpen" action="disable"&gt;<br>
Here is how the content of LineCounter.addin should look like after these steps:<br>
<pre>&lt;AddIn name        = "LineCounter"
       author      = "Daniel Grunwald"
       url         = "http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/LineCounterSDAddIn.asp"
       description = "Advanced line counter AddIn">
   
    &lt;Manifest>
        &lt;Identity>Grunwald.LineCounter&lt;/Identity>
        &lt;Dependency addin="SharpDevelop" version="2.0"/>
    &lt;/Manifest>
   
    &lt;Runtime>
        &lt;Import assembly = "LineCounter.dll"/>
    &lt;/Runtime>
   
    &lt;Path name = "/Workspace/Tools">
        &lt;!-- disable our menu item if condition "SolutionOpen" is not met -->
        &lt;Condition name="SolutionOpen" action = "disable">
            &lt;MenuItem id = "LineCounterCommand1"
                      label = "Show Line Counter"
                      class = "Grunwald.LineCounter.ToolCommand1"/>
        &lt;/Condition>
    &lt;/Path>
&lt;/AddIn>
</pre>Our menu item uses the "class" attribute. When the menu item is
clicked, SharpDevelop will create an instance of this class and call its Run()
method. This class is defined in the file Command.cs. The example code from the
template accesses the currently opened text editor and reverses the letters in
the currently selected text. We are not interested in accessing the text editor,
so we can delete the content of the Run() method and start writing our own.<br>
<h2>
  Testing
</h2>
However, first we want to get our AddIn running. For testing, we'll display a
MessageBox inside Run(). If you now try to compile the AddIn, you'll get errors
about missing references. This is because the template is missing the assembly
references to the SharpDevelop libraries - these have to hard-coded paths in
most cases, so you should add them manually. Add references to
ICSharpCode.Core.dll and ICSharpCode.SharpDevelop.dll from the bin directory of
your SharpDevelop installation. ICSharpCode.Core contains the AddIn system,
and also the base class for our menu command.
ICSharpCode.SharpDevelop is the largest part of SharpDevelop, it contains
the project system and many other things.<br>
Make sure you set "Local copy" for the references to
<b>False</b>.<br>
<img src="LineCounterSDAddIn/properties.png"><br>
<br>
You should now be able to successfully compile the project. If you look into the
bin/Debug directory, you will see a copy of LineCounter.addin, the compiled
LineCounter.dll and the debug symbols.<br>
If you want to test your AddIn, you need to register it with SharpDevelop. The
best way for testing is to copy these files to the AddIns directory of your
SharpDevelop installation. Restart SharpDevelop to load the AddIn. You
should see the "Line Counter" command in the Tools menu, disabled until you open
a solution. If you click the menu item, the message box should show up.<br>
If you want to update your AddIn, you'll need to shutdown SharpDevelop, copy the
files and restart it. If you do this a few times, you'll probably want to use a
separate installation of SharpDevelop to develop your AddIn, so you can leave
your development environment opened. <font size=1>Alternatively, you could use
Visual Studio to write your AddIn...</font><br>
<h2>
  Creating the line counter
</h2>
Now to the real work: Implementing the line counter. We want to display the line
counter user interface as a document, like the start page. Document views in
SharpDevelop are called <b>ViewContents</b>.
There are two types of view contents: primary and secondary. A primary view
content is capable of displaying something on its own; a secondary view content
extends another view content by displaying multiple tabs in the document -
SharpDevelop's Windows.Forms designer is a secondary view content. We want to
display a simple document view, so we'll use a normal (primary) view
content.<br>
<br>
Showing such a view content is easy:<br>
<pre>public override void Run()
{
    WorkbenchSingleton.Workbench.ShowView(new LineCounterViewContent());
}
</pre>
Now create the new class named LineCounterViewContent. Let it derive from
ICSharpCode.SharpDevelop.Gui.AbstractViewContent to get default implementations
for most of the IViewContent members.<br>
We will need to implement the abstract property Control - here we have to return
the control to display.<br>
<pre>
public class LineCounterViewContent : AbstractViewContent
{
    LineCounterBrowser browser = new LineCounterBrowser();
    public override Control Control {
        get { return browser; }
    }
    public LineCounterViewContent() {
        this.TitleName = "Line Counter";
    }
}
</pre><br>
This control is a UserControl copied from the
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/LineCounterAddin.asp" title="Visual Studio Line Counter article">Visual
Studio Line Counter article</a>
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/LineCounterAddin.asp" target="_blank" title="Visual Studio Line Counter article">[^]</a> &mdash;
copy LineCounterBrowser.* into the "Src" directory and use "Add existing file"
to add LineCounterBrowser.cs to the project. SharpDevelop should add
LineCounterBrowser.Designer.cs and LineCounterBrowser.resx automatically.<br>
Now we still have to change the parts where the line counter references Visual
Studio's EnvDTE class and replace them with the appropriate calls to the
SharpDevelop API.<br>
<h2>
  Accessing the project in SharpDevelop
</h2>
First fix the using-Statements: remove those importing Visual Studio namespaces.
Instead we will use:<br>
<pre>using ICSharpCode.SharpDevelop.Project;</pre>
Then remove the variable and property referencing the EnvDTE
object.<br>
Now move on to the methods. The first method requiring a rewrite is
"ScanSolution". We can simply get the solution instance from a static class:
ProjectService.<br>
<pre>    Solution solution = ProjectService.OpenSolution;
    if (solution != null)  // OpenSolution is null when no solution is opened
    {
        FileInfo fiSolution = new FileInfo(solution.FileName);
</pre>
SharpDevelop doesn't need "plural" classes like "Projects", but
uses the standard .NET collection classes. Unlike Visual Studio,
solution.Projects returns all projects; including those in solution folders.
It's implemented as iterator (with yield return), that's why you don't have
something simple as solution.Projects.Count. As I cannot really imagine
solutions with thousands of projects, we can just copy the values returned by
the iterator into a list to have a normal collection to work with.<br>
<pre>        List&lt;IProject> projects = new List&lt;IProject>(solution.Projects);
        tsprgTotal.Maximum = projects.Count;
        tsprgTask.Value = 0;
        foreach (IProject fiProject in projects) {
</pre>
As you might guess, IProject is the interface all projects
implement. The actual object type depends on the project type - every language
binding comes with its own project class (but SharpDevelop contains the classes
AbstractProject and MSBuildProject they can inherit most functionality from).<br>
The loop body can be simplified quite a bit: SharpDevelop will display its usual
error handling dialog box for unhandled exceptions, so we don't need to use
try-catch to redirect them to the debug view (where nobody really reads
them...). The language ID is a straightforward property of the IProject
interface, no need to query the CodeModel.<br>
<pre>        foreach (IProject fiProject in projects) {
            tsprgTotal.PerformStep();
            string projName, lang;
            if (fiProject.FileName.IndexOf("://") != -1)
            {
                projName = fiProject.FileName; // this is a web project
                lang = "{00000001-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}";
            } else {
                projName = fiProject.Name;
                lang = fiProject.TypeGuid;
            }

            int iconIndex;
            m_projIconMappings.TryGetValue(lang, out iconIndex); // default icon 0
            summary = new LineCountSummary(projName, iconIndex);
            m_summaryList.Add(summary);

            tsprgTask.Maximum = 0;
            tsprgTotal.Value = 0;
            ScanProjectItems(fiProject.Items, summary);
        }
</pre>
ScanProjectItems is the next method we'll look at. ProjectItems becomes
List&lt;ProjectItem&gt;. You'll also need to change the summary since
SharpDevelop stores all project items in this collection - no need to use
recursion to get Designer.cs files. In the SharpDevelop model, every project
item is exactly one file. This simplifies the method greatly:<br>
<pre>private void ScanProjectItems(List&lt;ProjectItem> projectItems, LineCountSummary summary)
{
    tsprgTask.Maximum += projectItems.Count;
    foreach (ProjectItem projectItem in projectItems)
    {
        tsprgTask.PerformStep();
        if (!(projectItem is FileProjectItem)) {
            // Skip references and other special MSBuild things
            continue;
        }
        string projectFile = projectItem.FileName;
        if (!Directory.Exists(projectFile))
        {
            int iconIndex = 0;
            m_fileIconMappings.TryGetValue(Path.GetExtension(projectFile), out iconIndex);
            summary.FileLineCountInfo.Add(new LineCountInfo(projectFile, iconIndex, summary));
        }
    }
}</pre>
Now try to compile again. The only thing missing is
"CodeModelLanguageConstants", a class containing the GUIDs for C#, VB and
(M)C++. SharpDevelop supports C#, VB, Boo and MSIL projects; this is not
matching the icons we imported from the Visual Studio AddIn. We'll look for a
way to get icons directly from SharpDevelop soon; for now just hard-code the
values for C# and VB:<br>
<pre>// Map project types to icons for use in the projects list
m_projIconMappings = new Dictionary&lt;string, int>();
m_projIconMappings.Add("{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}", 0);
m_projIconMappings.Add("{FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}", 1); // C#
m_projIconMappings.Add("{F184B08F-C81C-45F6-A57F-5ABD9991F28F}", 2); // VB
m_projIconMappings.Add("{00000001-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}", 5);
</pre>
<p>
  This fixes all compile errors. And if you test it, you'll find that it even
  runs correctly! :-)
</p>
<p>
  Although the extension process is very different in SharpDevelop and Visual
  Studio; the API is quite similar - after all, both are modelling MSBuild
  solutions and a similar feature set. I hope this shows you that porting
  AddIns from Visual Studio to SharpDevelop isn't very hard and we would like to
  see more SharpDevelop AddIns in the future.

<h2>
  Possible improvements
</h2>
While this is a basic port of the AddIn to SharpDevelop, there are lots of
possibilities for improvement.<br>
<h3>
  Getting Icons from SharpDevelop
</h3>
First, we to replace some bad code in AddFileListItem: Remove the code from the
"TODO: Add image index setting" command to the "lvi.ImageIndex = iconIndex;"
line and replace it with "lvi.ImageIndex = info.IconIndex;". Now only one
read-access on the m_fileIconMappings hashtable is left - the one in
ScanProjectItems.<br>
Before we can continue, we need to be aware how SharpDevelop deals with icons:<br>
Menu items are defined in XML and can be shown before the AddIn library is
loaded. Because of that, resource files can be registered in XML which makes the
icons inside it available to the ICSharpCode.Core.ResourceService. AddIns like
language bindings can register such file extensions and project types with such
icons. SharpDevelop's class IconService provides convenience methods for
accessing these icons: GetImageForFile or GetImageForProjectType get the icon's
name by looking up the project type or file extension. If you have an icon name,
you can use GetBitmap or GetIcon to access it. The ResourceService converts
between Bitmap and Icon on demand, but it is suggested to use .png bitmaps in
the resource files and the GetBitmap method to load them.<br>
This means with these simple IconService methods we can load the bitmap for the
correct project/file type, just like SharpDevelop's project browser does.<br>
The line counter code uses image lists with a few predefined images. Because I
do not want to change it, I will just introduce a new class ImageListHelper that
can add SharpDevelop icons to an existing image list.<br>
<pre>public class ImageListHelper
{
    ImageList imageList;
    Dictionary&lt;string, int> dict = new Dictionary&lt;string, int>();
    
    public ImageListHelper(ImageList imageList)
    {
        if (imageList == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException("imageList");
        this.imageList = imageList;
    }
    
    public int GetIndex(string imageName)
    {
        int index;
        if (!dict.TryGetValue(imageName, out index)) {
            index = imageList.Images.Count;
            imageList.Images.Add(IconService.GetBitmap(imageName));
            dict[imageName] = index;
        }
        return index;
    }
}
</pre>
We
will use two instances of this class to control the two image lists
imgProjectTypes and imgFileTypes.<br>
ScanSolution() is getting the icon index from m_projIconMappings - we will
change this line to use our ImageListHelper instead.<br>
Replace "m_projIconMappings.TryGetValue(lang, out iconIndex);" with<br>
<pre>iconIndex = projectImageListHelper.GetIndex(IconService.GetImageForProjectType(fiProject.Language));
</pre>Do the same for the file icons in ScanProjectItems():<br>
<pre>iconIndex = fileImageListHelper.GetIndex(IconService.GetImageForFile(projectFile));
</pre>
<p>
  Now the AddIn is using the icons shipping with SharpDevelop and will
  automatically use the icons of other languages added to SharpDevelop.<br>
</p>
<h3>
  Adding new counting algorithms
</h3>
The great thing about the SharpDevelop AddIn infrastructure is that it allows
one AddIn to extend another. We will modify the Line Counter in such a way that
it is possible for other AddIns to introduce new counting algorithms. We want to
lazy-load our counting algorithms only when a file of the specified type is
encountered.<br>
This leads to the doozer-descriptor-implementation pattern you will often see
for extendable SharpDevelop features.<br>
<br>
In the AddInTree, one can register classes - we already did this with the
command for our menu item. We will add a new path to the AddInTree containing
counting algorithm implementations. We will have to use classes instead of
methods to be able to register them in the AddInTree, so let's create an
interface and the classes:<br>
<pre>public interface ICountingAlgorithm
{
    void CountLines(LineCountInfo info);
}

public class CountingAlgorithmGeneric : ICountingAlgorithm {
    public void CountLines(LineCountInfo info) {
        LineCounterBrowser.CountLinesGeneric(info);
    }
}
public class CountingAlgorithmCStyle : ICountingAlgorithm {
    public void CountLines(LineCountInfo info) {
        LineCounterBrowser.CountLinesCStyle(info);
    }
}
public class CountingAlgorithmVBStyle : ICountingAlgorithm {
    public void CountLines(LineCountInfo info) {
        LineCounterBrowser.CountLinesVBStyle(info);
    }
}
public class CountingAlgorithmXmlStyle : ICountingAlgorithm {
    public void CountLines(LineCountInfo info) {
        LineCounterBrowser.CountLinesXMLStyle(info);
    }
}
</pre>The Count* methods in LineCounterBrowser have been changed from
"private" to "internal static".<br>
We still need a way to associate the algorithms with file extensions. This is
done directly in the XML code defining the AddInTree:<br>
<pre>&lt;Path name = "/AddIns/LineCounter/CountingAlgorithms">
    &lt;LineCountingAlgorithm
        id = "Generic"
        extensions = ".txt;.res;.sql;.cd"
        class = "LineCounterAddin.CountingAlgorithmGeneric" />
    &lt;LineCountingAlgorithm
        id = "CStyle"
        extensions = ".cs;.vj;.js;.cpp;.cc;.cxx;.c;.hpp;.hh;.hxx;.h;.idl;.odl;.css"
        class = "LineCounterAddin.CountingAlgorithmCStyle" />
    &lt;LineCountingAlgorithm
        id = "VBStyle"
        extensions = ".vb;.vbs"
        class = "LineCounterAddin.CountingAlgorithmVBStyle" />
    &lt;LineCountingAlgorithm
        id = "XmlStyle"
        extensions = ".xml;.xsl;.xslt;.xsd;.config;.resx;.aspx;.ascx;.ashx;.asmx;.asax;.html;.html"
        class = "LineCounterAddin.CountingAlgorithmXmlStyle" />
&lt;/Path>
</pre>Because we are using custom attributes, we are using a new codon
name "LineCountingAlgorithm". Don't be irritated that it's not defined in the
XML schema for .addin files - we are creating a new possible codon name here;
the XML schema is just for code completion when editing the .addin file.<br>
Now how can we define this codon type? Constructing objects from the AddInTree
is done by the <b>doozers</b> (the name comes
from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraggle_Rock#Doozers" title="Fraggle Rock: Doozers">these
guys</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraggle_Rock#Doozers" title="Fraggle Rock: Doozers">[^]</a>).
This means you have to register a new doozer for line counting algorithms.<br>
This is done by editing the &lt;Runtime&gt; section of your .addin file:<br>
<pre>&lt;Import assembly = "LineCounter.dll"&gt;
    &lt;Doozer name="LineCountingAlgorithm" class="LineCounterAddin.CountingAlgorithmDoozer"/&gt;
&lt;/Import&gt;
</pre>The CountingAlgorithmDoozer class has to implement the
ICSharpCode.Core.IDoozer interface:<br>
<pre>public class CountingAlgorithmDoozer : IDoozer
{
    public bool HandleConditions {
        get {
            // our doozer cannot handle conditions, let SharpDevelop
            // do that for us
            return false;
        }
    }
   
    public object BuildItem(object caller, Codon codon, System.Collections.ArrayList subItems)
    {
        return new CountingAlgorithmDescriptor(codon.AddIn,
                                               codon.Properties["extensions"],
                                               codon.Properties["class"]);
    }
}
</pre>This means our doozer will always build objects of the type
CountingAlgorithmDescriptor. Let's define that class:<br>
<pre>public class CountingAlgorithmDescriptor
{
    AddIn addIn;
    string[] extensions;
    string className;
   
    public CountingAlgorithmDescriptor(AddIn addIn, string extensions, string className)
    {
        this.addIn = addIn;
        this.extensions = extensions.ToLowerInvariant().Split(';');
        this.className = className;
    }
   
    public bool CanCountLines(LineCountInfo info)
    {
        return (Array.IndexOf(extensions, info.FileType.ToLowerInvariant()) >= 0);
    }
   
    ICountingAlgorithm cachedAlgorithm;
   
    public ICountingAlgorithm GetAlgorithm()
    {
        if (cachedAlgorithm == null) {
            cachedAlgorithm = (ICountingAlgorithm)addIn.CreateObject(className);
        }
        return cachedAlgorithm;
    }
}
</pre><br>
<p>
  Now the LineCounterBrowser code has to be changed to use the code we just wrote.
</p>
We will need a member variable storing the list of existing counting algorithms:<br>
<pre>List&lt;CountingAlgorithmDescriptor&gt; countingAlgorithms;
</pre>Initialising this list in the constructor is easy:<br>
<pre>
countingAlgorithms = AddInTree.BuildItems&lt;CountingAlgorithmDescriptor>
                        ("/AddIns/LineCounter/CountingAlgorithms", this);
// Iterate through algorithms to fill list of known countable types
foreach (CountingAlgorithmDescriptor desc in countingAlgorithms) {
    m_countableTypes.AddRange(desc.extensions);
}
</pre>
<p>
  And finally, replace the usage of m_countAlgorithms in the inner try-catch
  block in SumSolution() with this code:
</p>
<pre>
    foreach (CountingAlgorithmDescriptor desc in countingAlgorithms) {
        if (desc.CanCountLines(info)) {
            desc.GetAlgorithm().CountLines(info);
            break;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  So, let's reiterate how this extension model works:
</p>
<p>
  When SharpDevelop starts, SharpDevelop only loads your .addin file, but this
  bit of XML parsing is quite fast. Your .dll is not loaded, but SharpDevelop
  remembers where it has to look when the CountingAlgorithmDoozer is needed. Now
  the user opens a solution and clicks on "Tools &gt; Show Line Counter".
  Launching the menu command will load you AddIn assembly and create an instance
  of the ToolCommand1 class and call Run() on it. The LineCounterBrowser
  constructor now calls AddInTree.BuildItems for
  /AddIns/LineCounter/CountingAlgorithms. To build the items in that path, the
  doozer is required, so SharpDevelop creates the doozer instance here and uses
  it to build all items. The doozer does not create instances of the algorithm
  classes; it only creates a descriptor instance.
</p>
<p>
  Only when counting the lines in a file of any matching extension, the
  descriptor creates an instance of the class. The "AddIn" stored is the context
  in which the class name occured - it knows which runtime assemblies were
  specified in that XML file.<br>
</p>
<p>
  If there were additional algorithms in other assemblies (for example a Boo
  line counter), those assemblies would be loaded only if you count files in
  those languages.
</p>
<p>
  This means unused SharpDevelop AddIns use very little memory and startup time
  (if their extension points are coded properly) - it only takes parsing the
  XML, storing the resulting codons in a compact object tree where they are
  mixed with the other AddIns' codons.<br>

<h2>
  Creating an AddIn installation package
</h2>
Now to move to a completely different and much easier topic at the end: we want
to have an easy way for users to install, update and uninstall our AddIn.<br>
<br>
Creating a SharpDevelop AddIn installation package (.sdaddin file) is easy. Just
create a zip file containing LineCounter.addin and LineCounter.dll and rename
the zip file to "LineCounter.sdaddin". That really was everything you had to do
- double-clicking this .sdaddin file will open SharpDevelop's AddIn manager
where you can install the AddIn with just one click. AddIns installed this way
will be extracted to %Application Data%\.ICSharpCode\SharpDevelop2\AddIns.<br>
