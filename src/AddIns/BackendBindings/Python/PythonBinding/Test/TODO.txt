* ProcessRunner.Start throws an exception since the python filename
cannot be found.

	try {
		runner.Start();
	} catch (Win32Exception ex) {
		if (ex.NativeErrorCode == Win32FileNotFoundErrorCode || ex.NativeErrorCode == Win32PathNotFoundErrorCode) {
			throw new NAntAddInException(GetNAntNotFoundErrorMessage(AddInOptions.NAntFileName), ex);
		} else {
			throw;
		}
	}

* ActiveWindow is null.
* PythonCompiler.ImageFileMachine
* PythonCompiler.StaticTypes			

* Main entry point:

if __name __ == "__main__" or __name__ == sys.executable:
	main(sys.argv[1:])
	
def main(args):
	print "Hello, World!"
	return 0
	
* CtrlSpaceHelper.AddUsing should be called in the PythonResolver when
  the ExpressionContext is Importable.
  
	if (context == ExpressionContext.Importable) {
		pc.AddNamespaceContents(result, String.Empty, pc.Language, true);
		CtrlSpaceResolveHelper.AddUsing(result, pc.DefaultImports, pc);
		return result;
	}
  
* Custom IExpressionFinder.
   This is the only way to set the ExpressionContext to be Importable
   or a Namespace. This cannot be done in the resolver.

* Intellisense for built-in modules (e.g. sys).
   IronPython does define classes for these built-in types so we
   just need to work out a way to get access to them. The standard
   methods are available via the BuiltIn class (e.g. dir, print). The
   sys module is actually the SystemState class. Most of these classes
   have attributes that mark them as PythonTypes or PythonModules. These
   could potentially be used. There is also a PythonName property which
   could be used to limit the methods returned for a built-in type and
   map to the correct name.
   
* Extend SharpDevelop by providing an IronPython macro window.
   Ideally the code should be able to be debugged but this may be
   too difficult.
   
   The script should be able to access SharpDevelop and control it.
   
   A macro recorder is out of scope. One way to do this would be
   to rewrite SharpDevelop to use Command objects throughout. Otherwise
   all calls to objects that are provided to the script needed to be
   monitored and all calls recorded.
   
   Intellisense. Could use the same code used in the text editor.
   
   A way to load and run the scripts.
   
   A way to call a script from another script.
   
* Intelligent completion after a from statement.
    Typical statement is "from System import Console". At the moment
    code completion after the import is incorrect here. It needs to
    show items that are in the System namespace.

* The PythonDesignerGenerator inserts an event handler at the end
  of the active document. This is not correct. It should insert it at the 
  end of the form class. The file could contain multiple classes and 
  inserting the event handler at the end will not work in that case.
  
 * Python forms designer - default property values are incorrect. They should be based on the parent
   control. For example:
   
   ParentControl has BorderStyle = FixedSingle when created.
   ChildControl has ParentControl as base class.
   BorderStyle set to None in designer for ChildControl. Code should then be generated for BorderStyle since this
   is not the default
   
 * Event Handler loading code:
   
   Handle invalid event name.
   Check that += operator used.
   
* ContextMenuStrip
   
  If the context menu is added for the first time and left open and displayed on the form when
  switching to the source code you see an OwnerItem property added to the context menu variable:
  
  		self._contextMenuStrip1.OwnerItem = ContextMenuStrip

* Look at fixing the compiled exe so it can be run from a different folder.

 * Support for ListViewSubItems - Font, Colors.
 
 * Timer - Honour the GenerateMember setting.
 
 * Look at creating code for non-visual components in the same order as Visual Studio.
