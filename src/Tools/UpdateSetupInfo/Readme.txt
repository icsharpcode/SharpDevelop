Updates the SharpDevelop Setup information
------------------------------------------

Product Revision (Subversion revision number)

With WiX 3 the package code and product code guids do not need to be generated by 
this tool and can be autogenerated by WiX.

The build server and the buildSetup.bat executes the UpdateSetupInfo tool before 
building SharpDevelop.Setup.sln. The SharpDevelop.Setup project does not use the tool.

Operation
---------

1) The SharpDevelop.Setup.wixproj.user is is generated each time the tool is run
based on the SharpDevelop.Setup.wixproj.user.template file. The product revision is inserted 
into the newly generated file. The last used revision is written to a REVISION 
file which is put in the Setup\bin folder. This not in the repository and is only 
used to stop the tool from regenerating the product guid if the revision number has not
changed.

2) The build server and buildSetup.bat will run the UpdateSetupInfo tool.
This is not done by the SharpDevelop.Setup project itself intentionally so 
nothing changes when building the project from inside SharpDevelop. The
modified SharpDevelop.Setup.wixproj.user need not be checked into the
repository on each build on the build server.

Creating Releases
-----------------

When creating a release either the setup msi from the build server should be
used or that generated after running buildSetup.bat. This will revision number 
if the current revision has changed.
